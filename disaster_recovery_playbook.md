# Disaster Recovery Playbook

## Purpose
This playbook provides a step-by-step guide to recover the Kubernetes cluster from major failures.

## Steps

1. **Verify Backup Availability**
   - Ensure that etcd and other critical component backups are available and accessible.

2. **Restore etcd from Backup**
   - Run the etcdctl snapshot restore command on the latest etcd backup.
   - Example: `etcdctl snapshot restore <backup-file> --data-dir /var/lib/etcd-restored`

3. **Redeploy Control Plane**
   - If control-plane nodes are affected, use the restored etcd data directory to recreate the control plane.

4. **Rejoin Worker Nodes**
   - Re-add worker nodes to the cluster if necessary by running `kubeadm join` on each node.

5. **Verify Cluster Health**
   - Check all nodes, pods, and services to ensure full functionality.

## Notes
Regularly test backups and recovery procedures to ensure preparedness in case of a real incident.

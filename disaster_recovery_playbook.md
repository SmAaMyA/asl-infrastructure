# Disaster Recovery Playbook

## Purpose
This playbook ensures high availability and data integrity through verified backup restores.

## Steps

1. **Verify Backup Availability**
   - Ensure that etcd and other critical component backups are available.

2. **Backup Verification**
   - Use `test_etcd_backup.sh` to simulate restore and verify backup integrity.

3. **Restore Control Plane and etcd**
   - Follow `kubeadm init` and `kubeadm join` for control plane node recovery.

4. **Rejoin Worker Nodes**
   - Use `kubeadm join` to reconnect worker nodes after control plane recovery.

5. **Validate Data Integrity**
   - Perform data checks to confirm restoration success.

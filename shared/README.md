# Shared Configurations

This folder contains reusable configurations that apply across different environments, including:
- **policies/**: RBAC and security policies.
- **monitoring/**: Shared monitoring and alert configurations (e.g., Prometheus rules).

These files should be referenced by each environment as needed.

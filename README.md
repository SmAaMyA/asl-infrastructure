# Project Infrastructure

This directory contains an optimized, environment-specific structure for managing infrastructure scripts, configurations, and policies. Below is an overview:

- `environments/`: Contains `dev` and `production` subdirectories, with each service organized by functionality.
- `shared/`: Stores shared configurations, policies, and RBAC rules used across environments.
- `scripts/`: Houses standalone and reusable scripts.

Refer to each service or environment's README for further details.
